# arrays
implementation of basic arrays : definition, usage, input and output along with linear search algorithm using for loop.

note:
   I strongly suggest the reader to refer to the **in code comments** if they get stuck anywhere. In the code, necessary comments are written at all the places where someone reading the code might get stuck. All login flow and formulae/implementation is also explained via comments inside the code itself :). The comments will clear all of your doubts.

I would also like to mention that at the same time I have put considerable effort in making sure the code is as clean and readable as possible, and all the variable names are written in English language pertaining to the function they perform.

1. **arrays1:**

   basic program that illustrates the use of arrays in java. Definition of array, and retrieval of elements of array using different ways.

2. **arrays2:**

   program to let user create an array by inputting its size and then elements inside it.

3. **checkArrayAscending**

   takes an array of numbers as input and checks if it is an array sorted in ascending order.

4. **linearSearchAlgorithm:**

   implementation of linear search algorithm : take an array as an input from the user. Search for a given number x input by the user and print the index at which it occurs.

5. **maxMinArray**

   finds the maximum and minimum number in a given array of integers which is input by the user.
